## Overview
In this paper, we present **Embodied-Reasoner**, a multimodal embodied model that extends o1-style deep-reasoning capabilities to embodied interactive tasks. It can perform complex tasks in AI2THOR such as searching for hidden objects, manipulating and transporting items with several impressive features:
- *Deep reasoning abilities*, including **analysis**, **spatial reasoning**, **reflection**, **planning**.
- *Multimodal processing capabilities*, especially handling long sequences of interleaved image-text context
- *Environmental interaction abilities*, enabling it to autonomously observe the environment, explore rooms, and find hidden objects
- *Open-source models* released in 7B/2B sizes
- *Open-source dataset*: 9.3k interleaved observation-reasoning-action trajectories, including 64K images and 8M thought tokens.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
- **Task and Trajectory Engine:** Automatically synthesizes coherent **Observation-Thought-Action** trajectories, spaning 107 diverse indoor scenes, e.g., kitchens and living rooms, and covers 2,100 interactive objects (e.g., eggs, laptops) and 2,600 containers (e.g., refrigerators, drawers), \textit{64K} a first-person perspective image from interaction and \textit{8M} thought tokens. 

- **Long CoT with Diverse Thinking Pattern**: **analysis**, **spatial reasoning**, **reflection**, **planning**, and **verification**. These coherent, image-text interleaved trajectories boost its spatial, temporal reasoning capabilities.

- **Iterative Training Pipeline:** A three-stage iterative training pipeline for embodied model that combines **imitation**, **self-exploration**, and **self-correction**.

- **Interactive Evaluation Framework:** 809 test cases across 12 novel scenarios: `<Instruction, Key Action, Final state >`

## Performance
We compare the performance of Embodied-Reasoner against advanced VLMs and visual reasoning models. 
- Success Rate (%) measures whether a task is successfully completed. 
- Search Efficiency (%) evaluates task efficiencyâ€”more steps indicate lower efficiency. 
- Task Completeness (%) computes the proportion of predicted actions that belong to the set of key actions.

## Examples
### Simulator Experiments
Embodied-Reasoner exhibits spontaneous thinking behaviors, e.g., analyzing environmental states (#1,3), reflecting on missed details (#4), reasoning based on the latest observations (#5), and recalling cues for efficient planning (#9). These thoughts remain coherent and logically consistent despite spanning multiple rounds. In contrast, general VLMs lacking thinking abilities struggle with long-horizon interactive tasks and produce unreasonable actions, e.g., forget tasks or repetitive searching.

### Real-World Experiments
To evaluate the generalization of our reasoning model, we design a real-world experiment. Our model rules out the countertop and dining table after two explorations (steps 1,2), ultimately locating the coffee (#7) in the cabinet and placing it in the microwave for heating (#11). However, we observe that OpenAI o3-mini fails to formulate a reasonable plan, heading to the microwave first instead of searching for the coffee.
