## Overview ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰
In this paper, we present **Embodied-Reasoner**, a multimodal embodied model that extends o1-style deep-reasoning capabilities to embodied interactive tasks. It can perform complex tasks in AI2THOR such as searching for hidden objects, manipulating and transporting items with several impressive features:
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deep Reasoning</strong> abilities, e.g., <strong>analysis</strong>, <strong>spatial reasoning</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Interleaved Multimodal Processing</strong> capabilities, especially handling long sequences of interleaved image-text context</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Interaction</strong> abilities, enabling it to autonomously observe the environment, explore rooms, and find hidden objects</li>
      <li><strong>Open-source Models</strong> released in 7B/2B sizes</li>
      <li><strong>Open-source Dataset</strong> ðŸ¤— <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zwq2018/embodied_reasoner">Hugging Face</a>: 9.3k interleaved observation-reasoning-action trajectories, including 64K images and 8M thought tokens.</li>
    </ul>

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

> **Task and Trajectory Engine:** Automatically synthesizes coherent **Observation-Thought-Action** trajectories, spaning 107 diverse indoor scenes, e.g., kitchens and living rooms, and covers 2,100 interactive objects (e.g., eggs, laptops) and 2,600 containers (e.g., refrigerators, drawers), *64K* a first-person perspective image from interaction and *8M* thought tokens.

<p>  

> **Long CoT with Diverse Thinking Pattern:** analysis, spatial reasoning, reflection, planning, and verification. These coherent, image-text interleaved trajectories boost its spatial, temporal reasoning capabilities.
<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/state_trans.jpg" height="300" style="display:inline-block;"/>
<p>  

> **Iterative Training Pipeline:** A three-stage iterative training pipeline that combines **imitation learning**, **self-exploration tunning**, and **self-correction tunning**.   


> **Interactive Evaluation Framework:** 809 test cases across 12 novel scenarios: `<Instruction, Key Action, Final state >`

## Performance ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿
We compare the performance of Embodied-Reasoner against advanced VLMs and visual reasoning models. 
- Success Rate (%) measures whether a task is successfully completed. 
- Search Efficiency (%) evaluates task efficiencyâ€”more steps indicate lower efficiency. 
- Task Completeness (%) computes the proportion of predicted actions that belong to the set of key actions.

## Examples ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€
### Simulator Experiments
Embodied-Reasoner exhibits spontaneous thinking behaviors, e.g., analyzing environmental states (#1,3), reflecting on missed details (#4), reasoning based on the latest observations (#5), and recalling cues for efficient planning (#9). These thoughts remain coherent and logically consistent despite spanning multiple rounds. In contrast, general VLMs lacking thinking abilities struggle with long-horizon interactive tasks and produce unreasonable actions, e.g., forget tasks or repetitive searching.

### Real-World Experiments
To evaluate the generalization of our reasoning model, we design a real-world experiment. Our model rules out the countertop and dining table after two explorations (steps 1,2), ultimately locating the coffee (#7) in the cabinet and placing it in the microwave for heating (#11). However, we observe that OpenAI o3-mini fails to formulate a reasonable plan, heading to the microwave first instead of searching for the coffee.
